## SQLite Database & Nightly Updates

The project ships with a SQLite database (`azure_linux_images.db`) that is updated nightly via a GitHub Actions workflow:

- The nightly job performs a comprehensive scan (`--scan --comprehensive --update-existing --max-tags 0`).
- The updated SQLite file is committed using Git LFS to avoid repository bloat from daily binary diffs.
- Legacy JSON export is intentionally skipped in the nightly job (only the SQLite DB is maintained).

### Minimal (Empty) DB Fallback

If you clone the repository without Git LFS installed, you'll get a small text pointer file instead of the real database. The application detects this and will create an empty schema automatically so you can still run scans or tests.

You will see a message like:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Detected Git LFS pointer instead of actual SQLite DB: azure_linux_images.db
   Run 'git lfs install && git lfs pull' to download the full database, or proceed with empty DB.
```

### Getting the Full Pre-Scanned Database

Install Git LFS once per machine and pull the real object:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
git lfs pull  # downloads the actual sqlite database
```

If you already cloned without LFS:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

### Regenerating Locally (Optional)

If you prefer to build from scratch or the DB is missing:

```bash
python src/cli.py --scan --comprehensive --update-existing --max-tags 10 --database azure_linux_images.json
```

Increase or set `--max-tags 0` to scan all tags (can be slow).

### Why Git LFS?

Daily binary commits would otherwise inflate clone size over time. Git LFS stores only a pointer in the Git history and fetches the actual binary on demand.

### Summary

| Scenario | What You Get | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Clone without LFS | Pointer + empty schema auto-created | Install LFS if you need full data |
| Clone with LFS | Full pre-scanned database | Ready to query immediately |
| Want fresh scan | Run scan CLI | Adjust flags for depth/performance |

## Configuring Which Repositories / Images Are Scanned

The list of repositories and/or individual images processed by `--scan` (scan all) is loaded from `config/repositories.txt` if that file exists and contains valid entries. Otherwise a built-in default list of Azure Linux repositories is used.

Supported entry formats (one per non-comment line):

1. Plain Azure Linux repository path (MCR) ‚Äì e.g. `azurelinux/base/python`.
   * Treated as `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/python` with tag enumeration via the MCR API.
2. Fully qualified MCR repository path (no tag) ‚Äì e.g. `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/base`.
   * Tag enumeration is performed.
3. Fully qualified image reference with a tag (any registry) ‚Äì e.g. `docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim`, `ghcr.io/org/runtime:1.0.0`.
   * Scanned as a single image (no tag enumeration).

Notes:
* Lines starting with `#` or blank lines are ignored.
* Non-MCR repositories WITHOUT an explicit tag are currently skipped (multi-tag enumeration not yet implemented). List specific tags instead.
* After editing `config/repositories.txt`, commit the change so CI/nightly scans pick it up.

Example snippet:

```
azurelinux/base/python
azurelinux/distroless/base
docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim
ghcr.io/example/custom-base:1.0.0
```

## Nightly Recommendations Markdown

The nightly scan workflow now generates `docs/nightly_recommendations.md` summarizing the top (default 3) images per detected language, ranked by:

1. Lowest critical vulnerabilities
2. Lowest high vulnerabilities
3. Lowest total vulnerabilities
4. Smallest size

Generation details:
* Script: `scripts/generate_nightly_recommendations_md.py`
* Runs after the nightly database update
* Committed along with the updated SQLite database when changes are present

You can regenerate locally after a scan:

```bash
python scripts/generate_nightly_recommendations_md.py
less docs/nightly_recommendations.md
```

Adjust the script if you want a different ranking strategy or number of results (`TOP_N`).
