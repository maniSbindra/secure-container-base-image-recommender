## Pre-scanned Images

Following images are pre-scanned and added by default to the SQLlite database. These pre-scanned images also serve as an input to the [nightly recommendations](#language-specific-recommended-base-images-nightly). To configure which images are pre-scanned please look at [configuring which repositories & images are scanned](#configuring-which-repositories--images-are-scanned).

### Repositories (6 total)

The following repositories are configured to be scanned with multiple tags enumerated:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/nodejs`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/python`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/base`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/java`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/node`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/python`

### Single Images (9 total)

The following specific image tags are configured to be scanned:

- `docker.io/library/node:20.0-slim`
- `docker.io/library/python:3-slim`
- `docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:21-azurelinux`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:21-distroless`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:21-ubuntu`

_Note: Users can scan other images via the web UI or CLI

## Language Specific Recommended Base Images (Nightly)

Nightly scan workflow generates [`docs/nightly_recommendations.md`](docs/nightly_recommendations.md) with the current top images per detected language, ranked by:

1. Lowest critical vulnerabilities
2. Lowest high vulnerabilities
3. Lowest total vulnerabilities
4. Smallest size

Generation details (see [`docs/recommendations.md`](docs/recommendations.md) for rationale & future ideas):
* Script: `scripts/generate_nightly_recommendations_md.py`
* Runs after nightly DB update job
* Commits only when changes detected
* Adjustable result count via `TOP_N` in the script

Regenerate locally after performing a scan:

```bash
python scripts/generate_nightly_recommendations_md.py
less docs/nightly_recommendations.md
```

## Quick Start

### MCP Server (AI Assistant Integration)

The Container Image Recommendation tool is available as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, allowing AI assistants to directly query for secure container image recommendations.

#### Running the MCP Server Container

```bash
# Pull and run the MCP server from GitHub Container Registry
docker run -i ghcr.io/manisbindra/secure-container-base-image-recommender/mcp-server:latest

# Test with a sample MCP request
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "1", "method": "tools/list"}' | \
  docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/manisbindra/secure-container-base-image-recommender/mcp-server:latest
```

#### VS Code Integration

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "container-recommendations": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "--rm", "-i",
          "ghcr.io/manisbindra/secure-container-base-image-recommender/mcp-server:latest"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Available Tools:**
- `recommend_images` - Get secure base image recommendations by language/requirements
- `analyze_image` - Analyze existing images and get secure alternatives
- `search_images` - Search images by security level and other criteria

For detailed MCP server documentation, see [MCP Server Guide](docs/MCP_SERVER.md).

## SQLite Database & Nightly Updates (Summary)

Project ships with a pre-scanned SQLite DB (`azure_linux_images.db`) updated nightly via GitHub Actions (comprehensive scan + commit via Git LFS).

Quick facts:
* Nightly workflow updates SQLite database only
* Git LFS pointer auto-detected; empty schema created if real DB missing
* You can regenerate locally with the CLI scan command
* Full details, troubleshooting, and regeneration steps: see [`docs/database.md`](docs/database.md)


## Configuring Which Repositories / Images Are Scanned

The list of repositories and/or individual images processed by `--scan` (scan all) is loaded from `config/repositories.txt` if that file exists and contains valid entries. Otherwise a built-in default list of Azure Linux repositories is used.

Supported entry formats (one per non-comment line):

1. Plain Azure Linux repository path (MCR) ‚Äì e.g. `azurelinux/base/python`.
   * Treated as `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/python` with tag enumeration via the MCR API.
2. Fully qualified MCR repository path (no tag) ‚Äì e.g. `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/distroless/base`.
   * Tag enumeration is performed.
3. Fully qualified image reference with a tag (any registry) ‚Äì e.g. `docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim`, `ghcr.io/org/runtime:1.0.0`.
   * Scanned as a single image (no tag enumeration).

Notes:
* Lines starting with `#` or blank lines are ignored.
* Non-MCR repositories WITHOUT an explicit tag are currently skipped (multi-tag enumeration not yet implemented). List specific tags instead.
* After editing `config/repositories.txt`, commit the change so CI/nightly scans pick it up.

Example snippet:

```
azurelinux/base/python
azurelinux/distroless/base
docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim
ghcr.io/example/custom-base:1.0.0
```
