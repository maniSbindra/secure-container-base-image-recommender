# Nightly Top Recommended Images by Language

This file is auto-generated by the nightly workflow (`scripts/generate_nightly_recommendations_md.py`).
It will contain a per-language table of the top images ranked by (in order):
1. Critical vulnerabilities (ascending)
2. High vulnerabilities (ascending)
3. Total vulnerabilities (ascending)
4. Image size (ascending)

The content will update after the next nightly scan.
